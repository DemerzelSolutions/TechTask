# TechTask

Hi!

This is a technical interview task for you to do at home. Please take your time and don't rush it it is better for you to send better solution than to send it earlier.

In this solution you have 2 projects, Interview and Interview.Tests. In interview in CsvReaderWriter.cs there is a class that was written by an intern. This is library/utility class used to operate on csv files https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values .  Your task is to first review it and then later fix it. Please review it by leaving comments in CsvReaderWriter_review.cs file. Please add comments for all the issues you find with the current solution.

You can change the solution in any way you want. Add, remove, refactor all the classes and files (with exception of CsvReaderWriter_review.cs). Current implementation has some issues and we want you to fix them in best way possible - no restrictions.

Be sure not to neglect tests!

In orded to supply your entry you need to click "Use this template" button, create your own private repository and invite https://github.com/LukaszRozmej and https://github.com/tkstanczak as collaborators. Then develop your solution in a separate branch. When you are finished, create a Pull Request to master and add us as reviewers.
